## Users & Permissions - Linux Accounts & Groups

**Locations of Access Control Files:**
- /etc/passwd **
- /etc/shadow
- /etc/group **
---
- `sudo adduser [username]` = Create a new user *
- `sudo passwd [username]` = Change password of a user **

- `sudo adduser [username]` = Switch to Insert Mode ??


- **Note 2 different User/Group commands:**<br />

    - `adduser`, `addgroup`, `deluser`,  `delgroup` = interactive, more user friendly commands (not recommended in script cus of it's interactivity)
    - `useradd`, `groupadd`,  `userdel`,  `groupdel` = low-level utilities, more infos need provided by yourself

- `sudo usermod [OPTIONS] [username]` = Modify a user account **
    - `sudo usermod -g devops tom` = Assign 'devops' as the primary group for 'tom' user **
- `sudo delgroup tom` = Removes group 'tom' **
- `groups` = Display groups the current logged in user belongs to **
- `groups [username]` = Display groups of the given username **
- `sudo useradd -G devops selase` = Create 'selase' user and add selase to 'devops' group (-G = secondary group, not primary) ***
- `sudo gpasswd -d selase devops` = Removes user 'selase' from group 'devops' **

## Users & Permissions - Ownership and Permissions 

- `ls -l` = Print files in a long listing format, you can see ownership and permissions of the file

**Ownership:** **
- `sudo chown [username]:[groupname] [filename]` = Change ownership **
- `sudo chown tom:admin test.txt` = Change ownership of 'test.txt' file to 'tom' and group 'admin'
- `sudo chown admin test.txt` = Change ownership of 'test.txt' 'admin' user
- `sudo chgrp devops test.txt` = Make 'devops' group owner of test.txt file

**Possible File Permissions (Symbolic):**
- r = Read
- w = Write
- x = Execute
- '-' = No permission

**Change File Permissions for different owners**

File Permissions can be changed for:
- u = Owner **
- g = Group
- o = Other (all other users)

Minus (-) removes the permission **
- `sudo chmod -x api` = Takes 'execute' permission away for 'api' folder from all owners
- `sudo chmod g-w config.yaml` = Takes 'write' permission away for 'config.yaml' file from the group 

Plus (+) adds permission *
- `sudo chmod g+x config.yaml` = Add 'execute' permission for 'config.yaml' file to the group 
- `sudo chmod u+x script.sh` = Add 'execute' permission for 'script.sh' file to the user 
- `sudo chmod o+x script.sh` = Add 'execute' permission for 'script.sh' file to other 

Change multiple permissions for an owner **
- `sudo chmod g=rwx config.yaml` = Assign 'read write execute' permissions to the group
- `sudo chmod g=r-- config.yaml` = Assign only 'read' permission to the group

### Changing permissions with numeric values

_Set permissions for all owners with 3 digits, 1 digit for each owner_ [Absolute vs Symbolic Mode](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19455-01/805-7229/6j6q8svd8/)

- 0 = No permission
- 1 = Execute
- 2 = Write
- 3 = Execute + Write
- 4 = Read
- 5 = Read + Execute
- 6 = Read + Write
- 7 = Read + Write + Execute
<!-- -->
- `sudo chmod 777 script.sh` = rwx (Read, Write and Execute) permission for everyone for file 'script.sh'
- `sudo chmod 740 script.sh` = Give user all permissions (7), give group only read permission (4), give other no permission (0)
